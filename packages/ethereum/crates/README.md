# HOPR Ethereum Package

Draft readme, for rust migration

## Installation

1. `rustup`
2. `foundryup`

### Note

1. Three solc versions are needed

- 0.4: Permittable token, implementation of xHOPR. The permittable token implementation is extracted from the deployed xHOPR token. The only alternative done on the contract is to keep `pragma solidity` with the least version
- 0.6: Deployed Hoprtoken
- 0.8: More recent contracts
