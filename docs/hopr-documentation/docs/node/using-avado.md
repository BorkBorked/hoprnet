title: Using an Avado Node

To set up your AVADO Node, follow the instructions that came with the box. If you have a HOPR PC Node, it will come with HOPR pre-installed. All you have to do is download the HOPR client to start interacting with your node!

:::caution Warning
Please delete any old packages as necessary; make sure to withdraw your funds before doing so.

## Installing the HOPR client

While connected to your AVADO's network or via a VPN, go to the following [link](http://my.ava.do/#/installer/%2Fipfs%2FQmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy). Just click the install button and wait until the download completes.

If you are unable to use the link above, search for this hash in the AVADO DappStore:

```
/ipfs/QmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy
```

After you have installed the HOPR package, you can find the HOPR client in `my DApps`.

If the HOPR client asks you to enter a **security token**, paste the following into the command line: `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU` and hit enter.

The installation process is now complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
