(**5**) Simply, open the client and you should be greeted with the hopr-admin interface. That's all, you are now ready to start using hopr-admin.

Your **security token** is set to `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU`. You will need this to access hopr-admin.

If you are in the process of registering your node on the network registry please complete the process [here.](./network-registry-tutorial.md)

Otherwise, the installation process is complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
