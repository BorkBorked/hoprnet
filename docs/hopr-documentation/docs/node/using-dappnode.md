## Installing the HOPR client

While connected to your Dappnode's network or via a VPN, go to the following [link](http://my.ava.do/#/installer/%2Fipfs%2FQmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy). Just click the install button and wait until the download completes.

If you are unable to use the link above, search for this hash in the DappStore:

```
/ipfs/QmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy
```

After you have installed the HOPR package, you can find the HOPR client in `packages`.

If the HOPR client asks you to enter a **security token**, paste the following into the command line: `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU` and hit enter.

The installation process is now complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
