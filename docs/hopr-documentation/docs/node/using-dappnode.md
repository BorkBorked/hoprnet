## Installing the HOPR client

(**1**) Open the DAppStore using the sidebar to the left and enter the following hash into the search bar:

```
/ipfs/QmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy
```

![DappStore](./images/DappStore-NR.png)

(**2**) It should bring up the latest version of the HOPR client. Click **Get** and wait for the download to complete.

That's all! You should now be able to find the HOPR client in your 'Packages'.

Simply, open the client and you should be greeted with the hopr-admin interface.

Your **security token** is set to `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU`. You will need this to access hopr-admin.

If you are in the process of registering your node on the network registry, please complete the process [here](./network-registry-tutorial.md) before continuing.

Otherwise, the installation process is complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).

## Collecting Logs

If your node crashes, you will want to collect the logs and pass them on to our ambassadors on telegram or create an issue on GitHub. 

To collect the logs:

(**1**) Find HOPR in your packages and navigate to the backup section.
