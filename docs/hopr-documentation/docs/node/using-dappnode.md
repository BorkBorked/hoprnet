## Installing the HOPR client

Search for this hash in the DappStore:

```
/ipfs/QmPhSZTZbM6kd9VizvZpKDN3fQe5bqvCDooCBPYEUXdTcy
```

It should bring up the latest version of the HOPR client. Just install the package and you are good to go.

After you have installed the HOPR package, you can find the HOPR client in `packages`.

If the HOPR client asks you to enter a **security token**, paste the following into the command line: `!5qxc9Lp1BE7IFQ-nrtttU` and hit enter.

The installation process is now complete! You can proceed to our [hopr-admin tutorial](using-hopr-admin).
